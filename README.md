# Swift CRUD Example

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations example in Swift using a hypothetical "Task" management application. This example demonstrates how to perform basic operations on a list of tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It can serve as a starting point for building similar functionality in your own Swift applications.
